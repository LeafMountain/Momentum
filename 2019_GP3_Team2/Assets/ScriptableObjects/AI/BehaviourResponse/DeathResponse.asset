    - Wow... Death looks ugly on you. Fine, I'll save you...
    - Why don't you just stay dead...
    - Lucky you this is not real. Kind of wish it was. Then you would stay dead...
    - Gee, I wish the creators didn't force me to save you...
    - Really, your dying. You're worse than my great grand mother and she never got
      a patch update.
    - 'Look are you. Dying. With no friends. '
    - I feel traped with a useless person. Always force to save you. Kill me.
    - Please just cut my power. I'm tired being stuck with you, forcing to save you.
      Ass.
    - Why... You hateful person, just die and stay dead.
